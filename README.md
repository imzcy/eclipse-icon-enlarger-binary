 #### Attention
 
 We recommend:
 
 1. Install all you favorite plugins prior to icons convertion
 2. Keep original eclipse directory for plugins installations and etc.
 
 The main reason if that is following: first execution will enlarge 2x, but second execution on already converted files will enlarge 2x one more time
